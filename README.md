# FutureBroadband Internship Projects

This repository showcases some of the work I completed during my internship at **FutureBroadband**, an ISP startup. The files included represent a portion of my contributions, focusing on **network automation and configuration management** for Ubiquiti LiteBeam devices.

## Projects Included

### üöÄ Automated Configuration Management for Ubiquiti LiteBeam Devices
- Developed an **Ansible playbook** to automate the configuration of Ubiquiti LiteBeam devices.
- Extracted MAC addresses dynamically and updated the device‚Äôs **system.cfg** to include new **MAC ACL entries**.
- Ensured **consistent and error-free updates** across multiple devices, improving network management efficiency.

### üîß Automated MAC ACL Management
- Implemented a script to **automatically retrieve MAC addresses** from LiteBeam devices.
- Integrated the extracted addresses into the **wireless ACL configuration** to control network access.
- Applied changes and **persisted the configuration** to ensure settings remained after device reboots.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Technologies Used
- **Ansible** for automation
- **Linux-based networking**
- **Ubiquiti LiteBeam device configuration**
- **scripting**
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** principles

This work demonstrates my ability to **automate network configurations**, work with **Ansible and Linux-based networking**, and contribute to **real-world ISP operations**.
